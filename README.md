# dark-sky

This project uses [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/) to display current weather conditions to the user. I've built the application using primarily Model View ViewModel (MVVM) as the main architectural pattern. RxSwift/RxCocoa is used to bind the View and ViewModel layers. Using MVVM and Dependency Injection has greatly increased the testability of the application.
